Every two weeks, we meet physically and over Zoom to discuss causal texts drawn from a wide range of literature. For invited talks, the main speaker is the invitee. Otherwise, all attendees are expected **but not constrained** to contribute by:

1. Discussing the problems, questions, and objections raised by the authors
1. Clarifying points that may be unclear by the participants, or even proposing alternatives definition/written styles
1. Highlighting points that we estimate them as important and explaining why

## Location

Hybrid format at room XXX at LRI and via Zoom.
