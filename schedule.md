  - **Speaker**: Shiyang Yan (INRIA, TAU Team)
  - **Title**: Domain Generalization in a Causal Perspective: Deconfounding the Domain Biases
  - **Abstract**: Domain Generalization (DG), focusing on out-of-distribution generalization (Wang et al., 2021), aims to train a model on several source domains, and apply it on an unknown target domain. DG faces a key difficulty, the fact that each source domain suffers from a dataset bias. The contribution of the paper is to tackle DG in a causal perspective, where the source biases are viewed as confounders. Taking inspiration from the Deconfounder approach (Wang and Blei 2019, 2021), a non-linear independent component analysis (ICA) is used to learn substitute hidden confounders (SHCs). To mitigate the non-identifiability of the SHCs,  a novel adversarial contrastive learning scheme is used to learn domain invariant and mutually independent SHCs. The merits of the approach are comparatively demonstrated on several challenging DG benchmarks, yielding state-of-art performances. Ablation studies are conducted to determine the respective impact of the ICA model and of the contrastive learning scheme.
  - **Mini-bio**: Shiyang Yan is presently a postdoc researcher in the TAU research team of the National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology (Inria), Paris, France. Prior to that, he worked as a university lecturer at NUIST, China from 2020 to 2021. Previously, he has worked as a postdoc researcher at Queen’s University Belfast, UK from 2019–2020. He received a Ph.D. degree from the University of Liverpool, UK, in 2018. He received his Master's degree from Hohai University in 2015. His research interests include causal inference, reinforcement learning, and attention mechanism.
