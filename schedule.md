  - **Title**: Learning interpretable causal networks from observational data
  - **Speaker**: [Marcel Ribeiro-Dantas](http://mribeirodantas.me) (Seqera Labs)
  - **Abstract**: Uncovering cause-effect relationships in non-experimental settings has shown to be a very complex endeavour, given the numerous limitations and biases found in observational data. At the same time, there are many situations in which experiments cannot be performed, be it due to technical, financial or ethical reasons, and large amounts of observational data are available. Recent progress in causal discovery methodologies, and in the causal inference literature in general, has contributed to the development of techniques that learn the underlying causal structure of the events recorded through observational data, allowing us to perform causal discovery and inference in observational data. In this talk, I will go through iMIIC, a novel information-theoretic method that allows us to infer interpretable causal networks, and its application to a dataset of ~400,000 breast cancer patients.

  - **Bio**: [Marcel Ribeiro-Dantas](http://mribeirodantas.me) is a developer advocate at Seqera Labs. He holds a PhD in Bioinformatics from Sorbonne Université and Institut Curie developing causal discovery methods and investigating their application to breast cancer patients' data. He also holds two graduate degrees on Big Data and Health Informatics and an MSc in Computer Science  from Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) in Brazil, where he worked on gene regulatory networks and data visualization with data from cancer patients.

  - **Title**: Causality for ML Fairness
  - **Speaker**: [Sami Zhioua](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Sami.ZHIOUA/) (INRIA, LIX, École Polytechnique)
  - **Abstract**: Addressing the problem of fairness is crucial to safely use machine learning algorithms to support decisions with a critical impact on people's lives such as job hiring, child maltreatment, disease diagnosis, loan granting, etc. Several notions of fairness have been defined and examined in the past decade, such as statistical parity and equalized odds. The most recent fairness notions, however, are causal-based and reflect the now widely accepted idea that using causality is necessary to appropriately address the problem of fairness. This talk examines an exhaustive list of causal-based fairness notions and study their applicability in real-world scenarios. As the majority of causal-based fairness notions are defined in terms of non-observable quantities (e.g., interventions and counterfactuals), their deployment in practice requires to compute or estimate those quantities using observational data. This talk discusses also different approaches to infer causal quantities from observational data including identifiability (Pearl's SCM framework) and estimation (matching, regression, stratification, etc.).
  - **Bio**: [Sami Zhioua](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Sami.ZHIOUA/) is an advanced researcher at INRIA and LIX research group at École Polytechnique. His research interests include fairness and privacy in machine learning and AI in general. Previously, he worked on privacy enhancing technologies, reinforcement learning, and security and optimization of the Java virtual machine.
