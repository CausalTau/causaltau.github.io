<!-- ## Upcoming Seminar Presentations -->

* **Thursday, April 7th, 2022 at 10:30 AM UTC+1** [[Link to join](https://inria.webex.com/inria-en/j.php?MTID=m6744fb0489e22385e1538c4fef104f61)][[Add to Calendar](/files/CDT.ics)]
  - **Title**: Causal Discovery Toolbox: Uncovering causal relationships in Python
  - **Speaker**: [Diviyan Kalainathan](https://diviyan-kalainathan.github.io/)
  - **Abstract**: The Causal Discovery Toolbox (CDT) is a new open source Python framework for causal discovery from observational data and domain background knowledge, aimed at causal graph and causal mechanism modeling. The CDT package implements an end-to-end approach, recovering the direct dependencies (the skeleton of the causal graph) and the causal relationships between variables. It includes algorithms from the 'Bnlearn' (Scutari, 2018) and 'Pcalg' (Kalisch et al., 2018) packages, together with algorithms for pairwise causal discovery such as ANM (Hoyer et al., 2009).
