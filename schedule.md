  - **Speaker**: [Emilie Devijver](http://ama.liglab.fr/~devijver/) (CNRS researcher at Université Grenoble Alpes)
  - **Title**: Causal Discovery in Observational Time Series
  - **Abstract**: Time series arise as soon as observations, from sensors or experiments, for example, are collected over time. They are present in various forms in many different domains, as healthcare (through, e.g., monitoring systems), Industry 4.0 (through, e.g., predictive maintenance and industrial monitoring systems), surveillance systems (from images, acoustic signals, seismic waves, etc.) or energy management (through, e.g. energy consumption data). In this talk, we first introduce the main methods proposed recently, based on different approaches (Granger causality, constraint-based approaches, noise-based approaches). Then, we propose a new method, seen as a hybrid between the noise-based framework to find potential causes of each time series, and the well-known constraint-based framework to prune all unnecessary causes. By doing so, we rely on a lighter version of the faithfulness hypothesis, namely the adjacency hypothesis. Experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world time series illustrate all the presented approaches.
