  - **Title**: Causality for ML Fairness
  - **Speaker**: [Sami Zhioua](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Sami.ZHIOUA/) (INRIA, LIX, École Polytechnique)
  - **Abstract**: Addressing the problem of fairness is crucial to safely use machine learning algorithms to support decisions with a critical impact on people's lives such as job hiring, child maltreatment, disease diagnosis, loan granting, etc. Several notions of fairness have been defined and examined in the past decade, such as statistical parity and equalized odds. The most recent fairness notions, however, are causal-based and reflect the now widely accepted idea that using causality is necessary to appropriately address the problem of fairness. This talk examines an exhaustive list of causal-based fairness notions and study their applicability in real-world scenarios. As the majority of causal-based fairness notions are defined in terms of non-observable quantities (e.g., interventions and counterfactuals), their deployment in practice requires to compute or estimate those quantities using observational data. This talk discusses also different approaches to infer causal quantities from observational data including identifiability (Pearl's SCM framework) and estimation (matching, regression, stratification, etc.).
  - **Bio**: [Sami Zhioua](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Sami.ZHIOUA/) is an advanced researcher at INRIA and LIX research group at École Polytechnique. His research interests include fairness and privacy in machine learning and AI in general. Previously, he worked on privacy enhancing technologies, reinforcement learning, and security and optimization of the Java virtual machine.
