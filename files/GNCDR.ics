DESCRIPTION:The Uncertainty Quantification for Causal Learning working g
 roup is excited to announce that this Thursday\, April 21st\, Diviyan Ka
 lainathan from Fentech will further discuss his work "Generative Neural 
 Networks for Observational Causal Discovery" in our reading session.  \n
  \nThe reading sessions aim to enable everyone to discuss theorems\, pro
 ofs\, and experiments of the work that are usually quickly presented in 
 a seminar session. It also represents an opportunity for attendees to ha
 ve a deep view of the work\, as well as a favorable time to ask more cla
 rification questions\, discuss with the authors\, and envision future wo
 rks. \n \nThe meeting will be on Thursday\, April 21st starting at 10:30
  AM UTC+2.  \n\nYou can join the meeting online via Webex here (meeting

  2011 at LISN Campus Universitaire Bât. 660 Claude Shannon - Rue René Th
 om\, 91190 Gif-sur-Yvette.
