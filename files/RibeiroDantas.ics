DESCRIPTION:Title: Learning interpretable causal networks from observati
 onal data\nSpeaker: Marcel Ribeiro-Dantas (Seqera Labs)\nAbstract: Uncov
 ering cause-effect relationships in non-experimental settings has shown 
 to be a very complex endeavour\, given the numerous limitations and bias
 es found in observational data. At the same time\, there are many situat
 ions in which experiments cannot be performed\, be it due to technical\,
  financial or ethical reasons\, and large amounts of observational data 
 are available. Recent progress in causal discovery methodologies\, and i
 n the causal inference literature in general\, has contributed to the de
 velopment of techniques that learn the underlying causal structure of th
 e events recorded through observational data\, allowing us to perform ca
 usal discovery and inference in observational data. In this talk\, I wil
 l go through iMIIC\, a novel information-theoretic method that allows us
  to infer interpretable causal networks\, and its application to a datas
 et of ~400\,000 breast cancer patients.\n\nShort bio: Marcel Ribeiro-Dan
 tas is a developer advocate at Seqera Labs. He holds a PhD in Bioinforma
 tics from Sorbonne Universit√© and Institut Curie developing causal disco
 very methods and investigating their application to breast cancer patien
 ts' data. He also holds two graduate degrees on Big Data and Health Info
 rmatics and a MSc from Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) 
 in Brazil\, where he worked on gene regulatory networks and data visuali
 zation with data from cancer patients.\n\n \nJoin from the meeting link\
