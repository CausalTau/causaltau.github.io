DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Naoufal Acharki (École Polytechnique and TotalEnerg
 ies)\nAbstract: In many scientific and engineering domains\, inferring t
 he effect of treatment and exploring its heterogeneity is crucial for op
 timization and decision making. In addition to Machine Learning based mo
 dels (e.g. Random Forests or Neural Networks)\, many meta-algorithms hav
 e been developed to estimate the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (C
 ATE) function in the binary setting\, with the main advantage of not res
 training the estimation to a specific supervised learning method. Howeve
 r\, this task becomes more challenging when the treatment is not binary.
  In this paper\, we investigate the Rubin Causal Model under the multipl
 e treatment regime and we focus on estimating heterogeneous treatment ef
 fects. We generalize Meta-learning algorithms to estimate the CATE for e
 ach possible treatment value. Using synthetic and semi-synthetic simulat
 ion datasets\, we assess the quality of each meta-learner in observation
 al data\, and we highlight in particular the performances of the X-learn
 er.\n\nBio: Naoufal Acharki is a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate in statistics 
 and machine learning at École Polytechnique (CMAP) and TotalEnergies. Hi
 s academic and industrial supervisors are Josselin Garnier and Antoine B
 ertoncello. His work focuses broadly on causal inference and statistical
  learning\, including causal learning for optimization and decision-maki
 ng in uncertainty environment settings.\n\nJoin us online or physically\
