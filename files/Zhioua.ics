DESCRIPTION:Title: Causality for ML Fairness\nAbstract: Addressing the p
 roblem of fairness is crucial to safely use machine learning algorithms 
 to support decisions with a critical impact on people's lives such as jo
 b hiring\, child maltreatment\, disease diagnosis\, loan granting\, etc.
  Several notions of fairness have been defined and examined in the past 
 decade\, such as statistical parity and equalized odds. The most recent 
 fairness notions\, however\, are causal-based and reflect the now widely
  accepted idea that using causality is necessary to appropriately addres
 s the problem of fairness. This talk examines an exhaustive list of caus
 al-based fairness notions and study their applicability in real-world sc
 enarios. As the majority of causal-based fairness notions are defined in
  terms of non-observable quantities (e.g.\, interventions and counterfac
 tuals)\, their deployment in practice requires to compute or estimate th
 ose quantities using observational data. This talk discusses also differ
 ent approaches to infer causal quantities from observational data includ
 ing identifiability (Pearl's SCM framework) and estimation (matching\, r
 egression\, stratification\, etc.).\n\nShort Bio: Sami Zhioua is an adva
 nced researcher at INRIA and LIX research group at École Polytechnique. 
 His research interests include fairness and privacy in machine learning 
 and AI in general. Previously\, he worked on privacy enhancing technolog
 ies\, reinforcement learning\, and security and optimization of the Java
  virtual machine.\n\n* Join Webex Meeting\nhttps://inria.webex.com/inria
