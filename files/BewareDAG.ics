DESCRIPTION:Title: Beware of the Simulated DAG! Causal Discovery Benchma
 rks May Be Easy to Game by Alexander Reisach\nSpeaker: Alexander Reisach
  (Centrale Supelec)\nAbstract: Simulated DAG models may exhibit properti
 es that\, perhaps inadvertently\, render their structure identifiable an
 d unexpectedly affect structure learning algorithms. Here\, we show that
  marginal variance tends to increase along the causal order for generica
 lly sampled additive noise models. We introduce varsortability as a meas
 ure of the agreement between the order of increasing marginal variance a
 nd the causal order. For commonly sampled graphs and model parameters\, 
 we show that the remarkable performance of some continuous structure lea
 rning algorithms can be explained by high varsortability and matched by 
 a simple baseline method. Yet\, this performance may not transfer to rea
 l-world data where varsortability may be moderate or dependent on the ch
 oice of measurement scales. On standardized data\, the same algorithms f
 ail to identify the ground-truth DAG or its Markov equivalence class. Wh
 ile standardization removes the pattern in marginal variance\, we show t
 hat data generating processes that incur high varsortability also leave 
 a distinct covariance pattern that may be exploited even after standardi
 zation. Our findings challenge the significance of generic benchmarks wi
 th independently drawn parameters.\n\nOnline\n   - Join Webex Meeting: h
