DESCRIPTION:Title: Definition and estimation of a variable importance me
 asure of a continuous exposure\nSpeaker: Antoine Chambaz (Université Par
 is Cité)\nAbstract:  In [1\,2] we defined a new measure of variable impo
 rtance of an exposure on a continuous outcome\, accounting for potential
  confounders\, when the exposure features a reference level x0 with posi
 tive mass and a continuum of other levels. We also showed how to build a
 symptotic confidence intervals for it\, using the semi-parametric estima
 tion methodology called targeted minimum loss estimation methodology (TM
 LE) [3\,4\,5]. In the application\, which motivated the study\, the expo
 sure and response are\, respectively\, the DNA copy number and expressio
 n level of a given gene in a cancer cell. The reference level is $$x_0=2
 $$\, that is the expected DNA copy number in a normal cell. As for the c
 onfounder\, it is a measure of the methylation of the gene.\n \nThis two
 -part talk will present and discuss the theoretical\, computational and 
 applied facets of the study.\n\nBio: Antoine Chambaz is a Professor at U
 niversité Paris Cité\, member of the applied mathematics laboratory (MAP
 5). He is the head of the Statistics group since June 2018\, and the dir
 ector of the FP2M research federation. From 2012 to 2017\, he was a memb
 er of Modal’X\, the stochastic modeling laboratory of Paris Nanterre Uni
 versity. He chaired Modal’X from February 2014 to October 2017. His main
  research interest is in theoretical\, computational and applied statist
 ics.\n\nOnline\n  - Join Webex Meeting: https://inria.webex.com/inria-en
