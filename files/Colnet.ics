DESCRIPTION:Title: Combining randomized and observational data: Toward n
 ew clinical evidence?\nAbstract: The limited scope of Randomized Control
 led Trials (RCT) is increasingly under scrutiny\, in particular when sam
 ples are unrepresentative. Indeed\, some RCTs over- or under- sample ind
 ividuals with certain characteristics compared to the target population\
 , for which one want to draw conclusions on treatment effectiveness. Ove
 r the last decades\, several methods have been proposed to account for t
 his sampling bias\, relying on the RCT data\, and an external data set r
 epresentative of the target population of interest. We will review the d
 ifferent methods available and the current state-of-the-art. One of the 
 method consists in re-weighting the trial individuals to match the targe
 t population\, which is usually called Inverse Propensity of Sampling We
 ighting (IPSW). Such procedures require an estimation of the ratio of tw
 o densities (trial and target distributions). In this presentation\, we 
 establish the exact expressions of the bias and variance of such reweigh
 ting procedures  in presence of categorical covariates for any sample si
 ze. These results show how the performance (bias\, variance and quadrati
 c risk) of IPSW estimates depends on the two sample sizes (RCT and targe
 t population). In addition\, we study how including covariates that are 
 unnecessary to a proper estimation of the weights may impact the asympto
 tic variance\, for the best or the worse. We illustrate all the takeaway
 s twice: in a toy and didactic example\, and on a semi-synthetic simulat
 ion inspired from critical care medicine.\n\nBio: Bénédicte Colnet is a
