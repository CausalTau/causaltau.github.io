DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Diviyan Kalainathan\nAbstract: Causal discovery is 
 of utmost importance for agents who must plan\, reason and decide based 
 on observations\; where mistaking correlation with causation might lead 
 to unwanted consequences. The gold standard to discover causal relations
  is to perform experiments. However\, experiments are in many cases expe
 nsive\, unethical\, or impossible to realize. In these situations\, ther
 e is a need for observational causal discovery\, that is\, the estimatio
 n of causal relations from observations alone.\nWe will go through the t
 raditional methods to find causal relationships in observational data : 
 conditional independence\, Occam's razor.\nCausal discovery in the obser
 vational data setting traditionally involves making significant assumpti
 ons on the data and on the underlying causal model. This work aims to al
 leviate some of the assumptions made on the causal models by exploiting 
 the modularity and expressiveness of neural networks for causal discover
 y\, leveraging both conditional independencies and simplicity of the cau
 sal mechanisms.\n\nLink to join\nhttps://inria.webex.com/inria-en/j.php?
