* Thursday, March 3rd, 2022 - **Causal Discovery in Observational Time Series** by [Emilie Devijver](http://ama.liglab.fr/~devijver/) (CNRS researcher at Université Grenoble Alpes) [[Recording]()] [[Slides]()]
  - **Abstract**: Time series arise as soon as observations, from sensors or experiments, for example, are collected over time. They are present in various forms in many different domains, as healthcare (through, e.g., monitoring systems), Industry 4.0 (through, e.g., predictive maintenance and industrial monitoring systems), surveillance systems (from images, acoustic signals, seismic waves, etc.) or energy management (through, e.g. energy consumption data). In this talk, we first introduce the main methods proposed recently, based on different approaches (Granger causality, constraint-based approaches, noise-based approaches). Then, we propose a new method, seen as a hybrid between the noise-based framework to find potential causes of each time series, and the well-known constraint-based framework to prune all unnecessary causes. By doing so, we rely on a lighter version of the faithfulness hypothesis, namely the adjacency hypothesis. Experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world time series illustrate all the presented approaches.

* Thursday, February 3rd, 2022 - **Domain Generalization in a Causal Perspective: Deconfounding the Domain Biases** by Shiyang Yan (INRIA, TAU Team) [[Recording]()] [[Slides]()]
  - **Abstract**: Domain Generalization (DG), focusing on out-of-distribution generalization (Wang et al., 2021), aims to train a model on several source domains, and apply it on an unknown target domain. DG faces a key difficulty, the fact that each source domain suffers from a dataset bias. The contribution of the paper is to tackle DG in a causal perspective, where the source biases are viewed as confounders. Taking inspiration from the Deconfounder approach (Wang and Blei 2019, 2021), a non-linear independent component analysis (ICA) is used to learn substitute hidden confounders (SHCs). To mitigate the non-identifiability of the SHCs,  a novel adversarial contrastive learning scheme is used to learn domain invariant and mutually independent SHCs. The merits of the approach are comparatively demonstrated on several challenging DG benchmarks, yielding state-of-art performances. Ablation studies are conducted to determine the respective impact of the ICA model and of the contrastive learning scheme.
