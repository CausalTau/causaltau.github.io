Every two weeks, we meet physically and over Webex to discuss causal inference texts drawn from a wide range of literature. For invited talks, the main speaker is the invitee. Otherwise, all attendees are expected **but not constrained** to contribute by:

1. Discussing the problems, questions, and objections raised by the authors
1. Clarifying points that may be unclear for the participants, or even proposing alternatives definition/written styles
1. Highlighting points that we estimate them as important and explaining why

## Location

 - Physically at LISN Campus Universitaire Bât. 660 Claude Shannon (Rue René Thom, 91190
