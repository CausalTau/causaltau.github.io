<blockquote><p>Thousands of years ago, a revolution happened. Humans started to realise that certain things cause others and that changes in the former lead to changes in the latter. From this discovery, came science-based civilisation. <strong>All of this occurred, because humans asked a single question: Why?</strong> (Judea and Mackenzie, 2018).</p></blockquote>
