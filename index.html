<blockquote><p>Thousands of years ago, a revolution happened. Humans started to realise that certain things cause others and that changes in the former lead to changes in the latter. From this discovery, came science-based civilisation. <strong>All of this occurred, because humans asked a single question: Why?</strong> (Judea and Mackenzie, 2018).</p></blockquote>

<p>Causal 𝛕 hosts a biweekly meeting group to discuss advances in the field of causal inference, from both empirical and formal viewpoint. Everyone with an interest in discussing causal inference is very welcome to come along. We also host talks by researchers in the causal inference domain.</p>

<p>If you would like to present your research at the Causal 𝛕 meeting group, please contact one of the organizers, or send them a message through the <a href="">contact form</a>.
